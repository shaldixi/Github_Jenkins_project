# The below keys will set the enforcement levels of Anti-affinity rules. Default value is Soft. Setting loam, lmg & llb anti-affinity ensures that the respective pods don't reside on the same node.
# Similarly, setting loamLmg anti affinity would ensure that the MG pods dont coexist with the OAM pods. Only set loamLmg pod anti affinity if there are enough resources.
